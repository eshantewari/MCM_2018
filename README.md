## Initial Formatting Docs:
formatinitialdata will structure the data better (it will also split the file into four files, one for each state)
graphinitialdata creates a data dictionary and graphs specific attributes within and across states

## Understanding MSN Codes (copied from ESA website):
The MSNs are five-character codes, most of which are structured as follows:
First and second characters - describes an energy source (for example, NG for natural gas, MG for motor gasoline)
Third and fourth characters - describes an energy sector or an energy activity (for example, RC for residential consumption, PR for production)
Fifth character - describes a type of data (for example, P for data in physical unit, B for data in billion Btu)
